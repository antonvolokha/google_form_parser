1 Go to the Extensions page by entering `chrome://extensions` in a new tab. (By design `chrome://` URLs are not linkable.)

* Alternatively, click on the Extensions menu puzzle button and select Manage Extensions at the bottom of the menu.
* Or, click the Chrome menu, hover over More Tools, then select Extensions.
Enable Developer Mode by clicking the toggle switch next to Developer mode.

2 Click the Load unpacked button and select the extension directory.

3 Ta-da! The extension has been successfully installed. Because no extension icons were included in the manifest, a generic icon will be created for the extension.
